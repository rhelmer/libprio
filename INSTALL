===================================
=== INSTALLATION

Once you have installed NSS and SCons, compilation should be pretty easy.

To compile the code, run:
$ scons

To run the test suite, execute:
$ build/btest/btest -v

To print debug messages while compiling:
$ scons VERBOSE=1

To compile with profiling, run:
$ scons WITH_GPROF=1

To clean up the object and binary files, run:
$ scons -c
