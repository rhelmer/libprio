- Note: We try to free all memory in the common case, but don't guarantee much
  about memory leaks in exceptional cases (e.g., OOM)
- Note: We call the prio header <mprio.h> because there is an NSPR
  header called prio.h.

SECURITY-CRITICAL TODOS
* Check that NSS RNG usage is correct
* Implement public-key encryption for client packets


MISC:
* Address TODO notes throughout code

Optimizations/features not yet implemented:
* Server side compute
   Optimize polynomial evaluation step on servers.
   O(n log n)  =>  O(n)
* Use PRG to compress shares on client
* Add differential privacy noise to final data output
